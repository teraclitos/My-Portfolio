# My portfolio
I developed a personal portfolio using React.js, and I really enjoyed the process. Its classic style reflects my love for books quite well. The portfolio consists of a book where all my projects are showcased. Pages can be accessed by clicking on them. If you want to directly access a specific page, the book provides an index. In desktop format, the index is accessed through a homonymous link, while in mobile format, it is accessed via a hamburger button. The index allows you to navigate through the entire book. Reasoning the logic behind the functions that perform the navigation was quite a challenge.
